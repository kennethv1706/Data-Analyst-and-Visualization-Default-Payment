## Conclusion
To reduce credit card defaults, a robust customer screening process is essential, focusing on detailed evaluations of credit scores and past payment histories. For certain age groups, particularly those without steady incomes, periodically updating financial data and considering alternative income sources, like support from family, is crucial. Implementing a minimum savings balance requirement and considering home ownership status can serve as additional financial stability indicators. Credit card offerings and limits should be tailored based on work experience and income, ensuring that customers receive limits aligned with their financial capacity. For higher credit limits, requiring concrete proof of income, such as pay slips, helps match the credit limit with the customer's financial profile, mitigating default risks.
